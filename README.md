# Project-Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
This project uses pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify dog breeds and distinguish dogs from non-dog images. Built with Python and PyTorch, it evaluates three CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, AlexNet) for accuracy and runtime efficiency
